## Notes
This repository was cloned from a different repo that allowed for the chat functionality to work successfully with our prior repository code. The initial repo can be found at https://github.com/Napolo-Sim/Project-2-Trading-Site . All prior commits have been saved in this repository, but the working application code is all within this new repository.
